# 🔧 FIXED: Index Page Visibility Issues

## ❌ Problem Identified

The `static/styles/index.css` file was **CORRUPTED** with duplicate/overlapping content:

```css
/* This is what was in the file: */
.theme-toggle {.hero-home {
  width: 40px;    min-height: 90vh;
  height: 40px;    display: flex;
  /* ... broken CSS with two styles merged together */
```

This caused:
- ❌ **Symptom input field not visible**
- ❌ **Hero section broken/not displaying correctly**

2. **Created new clean CSS file** with proper syntax
3. **All styles now properly defined:**
   - ✅ Theme toggle styles
   - ✅ Hero section with animations
   - ✅ Symptom input section (fully visible)
   - ✅ Form styling with proper visibility

## 📁 Files Fixed

```
✅ static/styles/index.css  - REBUILT (was corrupted)
✅ index.html               - Already correct (has Font Awesome)
✅ static/styles/main.css   - Already working
✅ static/styles/header.css - Already working
```

## 🔍 What Caused The Issue?

The `index.css` file had **duplicate content merged together** - likely from:
- Multiple edits/saves overlapping
- File corruption during save
- Editor issue or automated formatting

The file showed two different CSS rules **merged into one**, like:
```css
.theme-toggle {.hero-home {
  width: 40px;    min-height: 90vh;
  /* Two rules merged = broken CSS */
```

## ✅ Everything Fixed!

**The page should now display perfectly with:**
- Visible hero section
- Visible symptom input field  
- Proper styling throughout
- All features working

**Test it now and let me know if you see any other issues!** 🎉
